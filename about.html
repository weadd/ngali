<span class="line"></span>
<p>Ngali Holdings is a Rwandan company investing in a wide range of industries across the continent of Africa.
At Ngali Holdings we are driven by the desire to see African markets grow. We specialize in long-term, wide-scale infrastructure projects with a holistic focus. Many of our investment opportunities arise from Research & Development Department dedicated to the research of barriers to economic growth.It is an exciting time to be a part of the continent’s private sector development, and we are privileged to have the endorsement of several key global leaders and African governments; in particular, the Government of Rwanda.Although we are committed to investments of high profitability and operational excellence, we believe our marker of success will always be that which we build that outlives our company; whether it be a home with new access to electricity, a society more deeply saturated with access to information, or a training school providing skills to technicians in Africa’s first aerospace company. We are proud of building a stronger Africa. We hope you will be too.</p>
